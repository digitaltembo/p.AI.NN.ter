# p.AI.NN.ter

p.AI.NN.ter is cleverly named because it is an artificially-intelligent neural network painter, get it?

Inspired by how cool [Peacasso](https://github.com/victordibia/peacasso) and [Stable Diffusion WebUI](https://github.com/sd-webui/stable-diffusion-webui) are, but also by the fact that they left a bit to be desired with regards to simplicity of use, this is a project for me to play with NN models for image generation and experimental UIs for using them.

Theoretically, to run, you only need an nVidia GPU and docker-compose installed, and then run
```
git clone git@github.com:digitaltembo/p.AI.NN.ter.git
cd p.AI.NN.ter
docker-compose up
```
on your machine. 

From there, navigate to localhost:5555, and explore to your heart's content.

Note that this is NOT meant to be something exposed to the wider internet, all kinds of things could go wrong - please just use for your own amusement.

All images generated are persisted in the output directory, prune as necessary.

Enjoy!
